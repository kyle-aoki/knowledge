# Knowledge

This repo is a demonstration of an alternative to confluence (or other internal wikis).

It uses Netlify to host static content. The static content starts at the root of the repository with `index.html`. There is a single `css` file called `index.css`.

The browser's back/forward buttons are used to navigate back and forth. Simple `HTML` elements are used in place of markdown.
